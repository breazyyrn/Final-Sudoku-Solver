# Final-Sudoku-Solver
This week we'll explore the game of Sudoku. In particular, you will write a stack-based solver for the game that implements a depth-first search algorithm. Once your code can solve Sudoku games, then you will explore how the number of starting values provided affects the complexity of the search for a solution.
